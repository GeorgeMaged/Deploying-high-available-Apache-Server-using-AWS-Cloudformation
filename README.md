In this project (Udagram App), I deployed web servers for a highly available web app using CloudFormation. I wrote the script that creates and deploys the infrastructure and application for an Udagram app from the ground up.
It starts by creating the networking infastructure followed by the computing part.


The files attached are: 
1)iaac-final-project.yml: YAML file contains the networking infastructure code.
2)iaac-parameters.json: Parameters file used by the networking script.
3)iaac-compute-final.yml: YAML file script contains the computing infastructure code.
4)demoservers.json:Parameters file used by the compute script.
